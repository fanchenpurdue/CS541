Running Buffer Management tests....

  Test 1 does a simple test of normal buffer manager operations:
  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
index is 1
index is 1
  - Write something on each one
index is 3
  - Read that something back from each one
   (because we're buffering, this is where most of the writes happen)
  - Free the pages again

  Test 1 completed successfully.

  Test 2 exercises some illegal buffer manager operations:
  - Try to pin more pages than there are frames
index is 5
index is 2
*** Could not allocate 101 new pages in the database.
diskmgr.DiskMgrException: DB.java: newPage() failed
diskmgr.DiskMgrException: DB.java: pinPage() failed

  Test 3 exercises some of the internals of the buffer manager
  - Allocate and dirty some new pages, one at a time, and leave some pinned
index is 5
index is 2
*** Could not allocate new page number 01
